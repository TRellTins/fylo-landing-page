Mobile view -> ![](./screenshots/mobile.png)

## My process

First I started with creating the layout of the mobile view. Once that Was complete, I added the fonts and color to the elements. Last I styled the desktop view and added the active styling for the buttons and links. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main thing that I learned on this project, was not adding padding to the body. I thought that this would make it easier to style the sections, but it was the opposite. Espically on the #stay-product-cont where I needed to make the background color fit the whole cont. The padding on the body made this a bit tricker and I had to use negative numbers. 

Another thing that I learned on this project, was the importance of taking time to actually plan the project and not just jumping in.
